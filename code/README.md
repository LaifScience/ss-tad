# Code folder (`code/`)

**Version:** _Pre-release_ 

The code in this folder is currently in "pre-release". We are still mid-code refactor (working through the list of things below and also on our upcoming projects :smile:), but we wanted to offer a quick snapshot for people to get a sense of what this approach is about, in the meantime. Currently, we offer a basic (older, mid-refactor) version of the SS-TAD code, which should be sufficient to get a sense of the overall architecture implementation. For now, you should run this with PyTorch versions pre-v0.2. If you encounter something weird, let us know in the Github "Issues" (chances are we are addressing it in the full release).

What's not here yet/coming up:
 1. Updated + additional code for the newer versions of PyTorch (v0.2+), among other things.
 2. Cleaning up the (at the time, necessary) hacks done to work around bugs in older PyTorch releases themselves.
 3. More code from the original work in general + better refactoring.
 4. Demo notebook(s)
